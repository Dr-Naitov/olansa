When it was first launched in the year 2011-12, people just couldn&#8217;t believe that a computer can be available in just $25.</p> <p> If you bought a Pi and wondering what should do with my Raspberry Pi, I have got your back. I am going to list some cool Raspberry Pi projects that you can start following in your free time.</p> <p> These Raspberry Pi project ideas are not limited to Pi. You can use them with other Raspberry Pi like devices such as Orange Pi, Khadas etc. </p> <h2> 25 Cool Raspberry Pi Projects </h2> <p> I have listed several these project ideas by categorizing them in terms of the level of complexity (beginner, intermediate, and advanced). Some projects need additional equipment and sensors as well.</p> <p> Of course, it is worth noting that it will be subjective to what expertise you have. So, let us take a look at the project ideas.</p> <p> <strong> Beginner Level Raspberry Pi Projects</strong> </p> <h3> 1. Media Server</h3> <span> </span> <p> Building a media server using Rasberry Pi is the most common and probably the easiest project there is.</p> <p> You can take a look at some of the best media server software available for Linux and get started.</p> <p> To know more about it, you can refer to the official documentation of using Kodi with Raspberry Pi (which is one of the media server software available).</p> Using Kodi On Raspberry Pi <p> P.S. There are some operating systems for Raspberry Pi that let you configure it as media center by default without additional efforts.</p> <h3> 2. Weather Station</h3> <p> If you&#8217;re good at building projects with electronic components, building a weather station using Raspberry Pi should be fun for you.</p> <p> This may not be the easiest one to start with but it&#8217;s quite simple if you carefully look into the project requirements.</p> <p> You will be able to collect weather data using a variety of sensors as per your requirements. The project has been listed on the official website to help you build it as easily as possible.</p> Weather Station Project <h3> 3. The Parent Detector</h3> <p> Yet another project from Raspberry Pi&#8217;s official website, this project uses minimal hardware to set up a motion detector which then triggers a video recording using the Raspberry Pi camera module.</p> <p> The use-case for this can be a lot of things. If you are a parent, you can keep an eye on your child when they enter their room. In either case, this can also come in handy to keep an eye on your door as a security measure to check when someone arrives.</p> <p> You can find all the necessary details on Raspberry Pi&#8217;s official site.</p> The Parent Detector <h3> 4. FM Radio Station</h3> <p> Raspberry Pi is an inexpensive device for making an FM radio station. The pre-requisites may not be much but is worth exploring for fun.</p> <p> Do note that you may not want to interfere with the local FM frequencies. You can find all the details to set it up by clicking the button below.</p> FM Radio Transmitter <h3> 5. Minecraft Game Sever</h3> <p> Minecraft is a quite popular game. However, if you want a personal server, you might have to pay a premium.</p> <p> Fret not, you can use your Raspberry Pi to build a local server, create your own world and have fun with your family/friends.</p> Minecraft Game Server <h3> 6. Temperature Log</h3> <p> It was something interesting I found on the official website to help you learn a few things like how to write data to a file etc. </p> <p> Here, you will be recording the temperature using the sensor present.</p> <p> For this, you will be utilizing the command-line to monitor the temperature of Raspberry Pi. </p> Temperature Log <h3> 7. Retro Gaming Console</h3> <p> You can turn your Raspberry Pi into a gaming console by simply installing an OS on an SD card and transfer a few files to it.</p> <p> We also have an article on how you can turn your old PC into a Retrogaming console if you are curious.</p> <p> I have linked a resource to help you make this project in the button below:</p> Retro Gaming Console <h3> 8. Full-Fledged Desktop</h3> <p> If you do not want to invest a lot to build a PC, you can easily utilize your Raspberry Pi to build one.</p> <p> Technically, your Raspberry Pi will be the heart of your PC and you will need to add accessories (monitor, keyboard, mouse, etc) to turn it into a PC. You can also choose to build a custom case for the board if you want which is totally optional.</p> <p> Obviously, the PC won&#8217;t be powerful enough for all kinds of tasks but it will be usable. You can also check out the experience of having Raspberry Pi 4 as a desktop replacement on their official website as a reference to this project.</p> Full-Fledged Desktop <p> <strong> Intermediate Level Raspberry Pi Project Ideas</strong> </p> <h3> 9. Build a LAMP Web Server with WordPress</h3> <p> If you are into web development, you can try setting up a LAMP (Linux + Apache + MySQL + PHP) server and install WordPress to create a website. You can also choose to make something else from scratch without installing WordPress.</p> <p> You will be able to access the site on any device on the same network as your Raspberry Pi.</p> Build a LAMP Web Server <h3> 10. Laser Tripwire</h3> <span> </span> <p> It is a similar concept to the parent detector that uses a motion sensor. In this case, a laser beam is used to detect activity whenever someone breaks the beam.</p> <p> You just need a few things to set up the alarm and complete the tripwire. Of course, this is a simple project to start with that has potentially different applications.</p> Laser Tripwire <h3> 11. Print Server</h3> <p> What if you can turn your old printer to work on a network of devices even without requiring a built-in WiFi feature?</p> <p> Well, that&#8217;s what this project is about. You will be able to access your printer from multiple devices using a print server. Check out all the details to help build one by clicking the button below.</p> Raspberry Pi Print Server <h3> 12. Time Lapse Camera</h3> <p> Looking for a cheap dedicated time-lapse camera? Well, you can do it yourself with a Raspberry Pi.</p> <p> You can use the Pi camera module or explore other options as well.</p> Time-Lapse Camera <h3> 13. Music Box</h3> <span> </span> <p> You can build a button-controlled music box using Raspberry Pi to have a great time with your kids or anyone who loves music.</p> <p> When you press a button, it will play a sound. You can find the short description of the project in the video above, for more details click on the button below.</p> Music Box <h3> 14. Google Home On Raspberry Pi</h3> <span> </span> <p> If you could configure and set up Google Assistant on your Raspberry Pi, you can turn it into an inexpensive Google Home DIY alternative, right?</p> <p> Fortunately, you can achieve that with your Raspberry Pi. Find out more about it in the video above.</p> <h3> 15. Build Smart TV Box</h3> <p> If you know how to set up a media server on Raspberry Pi (as mentioned in the first project idea of this article), you can make this happen too.</p> <p> With the help of the Kodi box (or similar), you can build your own personal smart TV box powered by the media server of your choice.</p> Smart TV Box <h3> 16. Add Gesture Controls To Raspberry Pi</h3> <p> You can add the ability to have gesture controls for any of your projects on Raspberry Pi using a Flick board .</p> <p> It may not be the cheapest project but it is an impressive touch for your Raspberry Pi project.</p> Gesture Controls <p> <strong> Advanced Level Raspberry Pi Project Ideas</strong> </p> <h3> 17. Tor Router</h3> <p> If you are someone who wants to explore ways to enhance your personal digital privacy, you can start by building your own local Tor onion router.</p> <p> With this, you can scramble your Internet connection and remain anonymous with your browsing activities. It is just something like a VPN but technically different.</p> Tor Router <h3> 18. Control LEDs with your voice</h3> <p> This is quite interesting. I have already mentioned a project where you can set up Google Assistant on your Raspberry Pi. However, in this case, you will be able to control the LEDs with your voice.</p> <p> You will not need the assistant this time, all you need is the Google AIY voice kit . This has been featured on the list of official DIY projects using Raspberry Pi, you can get more information there.</p> Control LEDs With Voice <h3> 19. WiFi Extender</h3> <p> If you want to increase the range of your WiFi network, you might have to opt for a premium gadget that can help you do that or you can utilize Raspberry Pi to get the job done.</p> <p> Yes, that&#8217;s right, you can build a WiFi extender by just using your Raspberry Pi.</p> WiFi Extender <h3> 20. VPN Server</h3> <p> You do not need to trust the VPN providers if you can build your own local VPN server. It can be quite challenging to make it happen.</p> <p> So, if you are up for some action, you can use your Raspberry Pi to make a private VPN server for your connection. Explore more about it here:</p> VPN Server <h3> 21. Home Automation Using Raspberry Pi</h3> <p> A lot of powerful projects can be done using the Raspberry Pi, one of which is &#8216;Home Automation&#8217;.</p> <p> If I want to implement home automation, it will be expensive. But, if I end up using Raspberry Pi to create something similar, it will require less investment. Of course, you will have to explore and improve to make it a reliable system but you can get started with the basics.</p> Home Automation <h3> 22. Local Cloud Server </h3> <p> You can also build your own cloud using Raspberry Pi. You can also install Nextcloud on it to protect and store your data.</p> <p> A lot of exciting things to explore once you have your own cloud, right?</p> Local Cloud Server <h3> 23. Portable Hacking Device</h3> <p> Let me make one thing clear, I am not encouraging you to do something illegal (just like the movies) by building a portable hacking device.</p> <p> So, just for educational/testing purposes, feel free to try making your own portable device for hacking using Raspberry Pi.</p> Portable Hacking Device <h3> 24. Smart Gloves</h3> <span> </span> <p> Making a pair of smart gloves is really a cool project with Raspberry Pi. In my college days, I witnessed a senior make this thing, it was interesting.</p> <p> You can refer to the official resource for this project and get started.</p> Smart Gloves <h3> 25. Ad Blocker</h3> <span> </span> <p> With Raspberry Pi, you can easily implement a network-wide Adblocker so that you won&#8217;t have to install adblockers separately on devices or browsers. </p> <p> You need to utilize Pi-Hole (the ad blocker) to set it up. Check out the video above and the official resource through the button below.</p> Ad Blocker <p> <strong> Wrapping Up</strong> </p> <p> Here, I listed some of the most interesting projects that I could find that might come in handy for you. Some of these projects can be created with cheaper and smaller Raspberry Pi Zero like devices as well. We do have a dedicated list of Raspberry Pi Zero W projects as well.</p> <p> If you know some other cool ideas, let me know in the comments down below. I might update this list of Raspberry Pi projects with your idea.</p> <br> <span> </span> <span> </span> </p> <p> <span> Like what you read?
